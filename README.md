# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub. I intend to use this as project to understand this platform better.
I am a Project manager who uses data to optimize processes and optimize results.
My skillset includes data analytics, project management, written and verbal English communication, operations,content writing and research
I have developed an excel based tool which can be used to manage and drive the OKRs of a small team over the period of a year.
I'm interested in uploading the said tool onto my GitHub profile so it can be improved upon and hopefully used by other project managers.
